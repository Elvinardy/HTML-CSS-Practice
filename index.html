        <h3><a href="#">An Unconvenient Truth</a></h3>
        <p>Here are 6 important reasons why we should care about the environment.
        <li>
            <ol>1. To Enhance Human Health<br>
                The state of the environment plays a huge role in our overall health. Outdoor air pollution can lead to harmful diseases like asthma and bronchitis. It can also affect the quality of our food, which can lead to the ingestion of dangerous toxins. The cleaner our environment is, the better chance we have at living a healthy life.</ol>
            <ol>2. To Protect Our Ecosystem<br>
                The way we treat the environment has a direct impact on the world’s most vulnerable species. Multiple species are at risk of extinction due to irresponsible human behavior. If we want to protect these precious animals, we must strive to preserve their natural habitats. This means reducing pollution, making educated consumer choices and traveling responsibly. Supporting eco-tourism efforts that help protect wildlife is important. Eco-friendly tours educate tourists about animal conservation and the importance of environmental protection.</ol>
            <ol>3. To Protect Our Natural Resources<br>
                Our natural resources are limited, which affects the sustainability of our communities. Making sustainable and renewable choices in your daily life will help to preserve these crucial resources. This means using less plastic, choosing eco-friendly products and minimizing food waste. These are simple practices that everyone can integrate into their life. If we want our communities to thrive, we must allow nature to thrive as well.</ol>
            <ol>4. To Combat Climate Change<br>
                As the Earth’s temperature continues to rise, we are seeing more and more dangerous weather patterns emerging. This is largely due to the human activity that has created increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. For the future of our planet, it is our moral responsibility to help combat climate change. Making a genuine effort to protect our environment on a daily basis will make all the difference to our future.</ol>
            <ol>5. To Foster Economic Growth<br>
                rotecting the environment also has benefits for the economy. A healthy environment helps to boost nature based-tourism and encourage responsible travel practices. The eco-tourism sector is a huge contributor to many economies around the world. It can help fund conservation projects, create jobs, and increase the economic value of local communities.</ol>
